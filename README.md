# image_classifier
Image classifier that identifies flower type using PyTorch.  This is just the code used and not all files required to run the program/files.

## Overview
This is a project I completed for my Udacity Nano Degree program. I first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

In order to complete this project, you will need to use the GPU support.  All the files are not available.  The image classifier trains about 20 images of flowers in 102 different types, therefore, the size of all images will be too large to store on Github.

## Files
-  `Image classifier Project.IPYNB`: Jupyter notebook that goes though the process of training and testing the image classifier.
-  `Image classifier Project.html`: HTML version of the Jupyter notebook above.
-  `train.py`:  python program that trains and saves the model.
-  `predict.py`:  python program that loads model in `train.py` and makes a prediction of an image given a file location.
